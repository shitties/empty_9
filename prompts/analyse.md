Analyze the provided dataset with a strict focus on business value and decision-making insights, rather than technical or statistical explanations.

Your deliverables must include the following components:

Charts Generation

Create a dedicated directory named charts/.

Implement a Python script named scripts/generate_charts.py that produces all required visualizations.

Use only business-appropriate chart types (e.g., bar charts, line charts, stacked charts).

Do not use pie charts under any circumstances.

Insights and Findings

Identify key trends, patterns, anomalies, and relationships within the data that are relevant to business stakeholders.

Ensure every major insight is directly supported by one or more charts.

Prioritize insights that can influence strategy, operations, performance optimization, or risk reduction.

README Presentation Document

Document all findings in a README.md file.

The README must be written as a presentation-style narrative for non-technical stakeholders (e.g., executives, product owners, business managers).

Avoid implementation details, code explanations, or technical terminology.

Clearly explain:

What the charts show

Why the findings matter to the business

What decisions or actions could be informed by these insights

Scope and Focus

The analysis must remain strictly business-oriented.

Do not include algorithmic explanations, data preprocessing details, or model-level discussions.

Treat the README as a final business insight report, not a technical documentation file.

The final output should be suitable for direct inclusion in a business presentation or executive review.
